<p style="text-align: center;"><em>SAVE OUR SCHOOL'S WIFI.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>-- Welcome to SOSW. --</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our goal with SOSW is to provide free internet to our school. That means no more blocked websites, and we can access the internet outside of school securely.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">-- Limitations --</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of course, SOSW doesn't come without limitations. SOSW is run on a repl with very little memory and processing power. Lots of games websites have crashed on our testing so don't expect it to be perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Theres also the fact that the SOSW servers are not in the school. The servers are located somewhere around the world, and you just have to get used to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Also, SOSW is hosted on a linux-based system, which means it can't run things like Roblox and Steam*</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*you can, but theres not enough processing power, and Roblox isn't officially supported on linux, so we're not trying that.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">-- Versions --</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please note that many releases of SOSW are based on someone else's idea and thier projects.</p>
