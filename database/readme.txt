Simple File List gives your WordPress website a list of your files which allows your users to open and download them.

== Description ==

Simple File List is a free plugin that is great for when you need to provide a list of files, either publicly available or private to logged-in users. Place a file list anywhere on your site using a simple shortcode, allowing your front-end users to open, download and optionally edit them. Users can also upload files if you choose.

Simple File List is also a good alternative for organizations using clumsy FTP or Dropbox for larger files. Simply provide your clients with a link to their file list.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Who is Simple File List for? =

A: Anyone who exchanges files with clients, customers or within an organization.

= Q: Are the file uploaded to the Media Library? =

A: No, files are uploaded to a special folder inside your general WordPress uploads folder, or anywhere you specify.

= Q: Can I limit the access to my file to only logged-in users? =

Yes, you can limit to Admins or anyone who is logged in. If you need further users access control, consider the <a href="https://simplefilelist.com/file-access-manager/">File Access Manager</a> extension*.

= Q: Can people who upload overwrite existing files? =

A: No, by default a file will not be overwritten. If a file is uploaded having the same name as one already present, a series number is appended to the name ( filename_(2).ext ). If you don’t want this, uncheck the box on the Upload Settings tab. 

= Q: Can I place different lists in different places? =

A: Yes, you can put place your file lists on different posts, pages and widgets. If you upgrade to the <a href="https://simplefilelist.com">Pro</a>version, you can even place different folders on your site.

= Q: Are the files in the list searchable by Google and other search engines? =

A: Only if you place a list on the front-side of your website which is viewable to the general public. If you choose USER, ADMIN or NO, in the List Settings these files will not be indexed by search engines.

= Q: Can I customize the appearance of the list and uploader? =

A: Yes, the CSS is easily over-ridden, making it easy for anyone with CSS knowledge to customize the page design. Check the Instructions page within the plugin's admin panel for more info.

= Q: Can I create custom behavior after an upload completes? =

A: Yes, you can hook into the actions "eeSFL_UploadCompleted" and "eeSFL_UploadCompletedAdmin" and do pretty much anything you want upon upload completion.

= Q: What is the maximum upload file size? =

A: This is a setting that you choose in the file configuration. The initial default is 8 MB. The absolute maximum size will depend on your hosting setup. which is automatically detected.

= Q: What if I have trouble or need assistance? Will you help? =

A: Yes! I enjoy helping people. Please contact me with any issues using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-file-list/">WordPress Forum</a> or via <a href="https://simplefilelist.com/get-support/">simplefilelist.com</a>

= Q: Why did you develop this plugin? =

A: I got frustrated with the difficulties of getting files back and forth between myself and my non-technical clients once they become too large for email, and having an archive for them to return to was needed. Training these people to use FTP or Dropbox was a challenge. I wanted something simple that I could use on my own website, so I created a simple index.php page that solved my problem. I later realized that others could benefit from this functionality, so I decided to port it to my favorite website platform; WordPress. I also hoped that the donations would pay for a large home and a private jet, but that has not happened yet :-(  Regardless, I still enjoy giving to the community and helping others.
